# Olympic Medal Search Program

### About the Project

---

This program is an Olympic Medal search program that searches an Olympic year and season, and displays the top 10 performing countries by medal. Ties are broken with total golds, then silvers, then bronze medals.

This project was created for my IPC145 (Introduction to Programming in C) final project and implements data validation, dynamic memory, file handling, and more! All code was written by me, none was provided as part of the project.

### Getting Started

---

1. Clone the repo to your local computer

2. Open the files in an IDE (this was coded using VisualStudio)

3. Build and run on the command line

4. Follow the prompts to enter a year and season of the Olympics! (e.g. 2018 Winter)
